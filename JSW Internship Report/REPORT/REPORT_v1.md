# Abstract

**Project Summary:**
The Metal Cost Management System (MCMS) is a centralized, enterprise-grade web application engineered during an industrial internship at JSW Steel Ltd., Dolvi. The Indian steel manufacturing sector operates in a hyper-competitive global market where profitability is directly tied to the highly volatile costs of raw iron ore and specialized ferro-alloys. Prior to this project, JSW Steel’s Costing Department relied on decentralized, manually operated spreadsheet models to calculate the cost per metric tonne of thousands of distinct steel grades. This legacy approach caused data fragmentation, lacked immutable audit trails, and presented significant financial risks due to formula corruption vulnerabilities. The MCMS was developed to replace these manual processes, acting as the definitive Single Source of Truth (SSOT) for all metallurgical cost tracking, grade composition limits, and financial scenario analysis.

**Objectives:**
The primary objective of the internship project was to design, build, and deploy a secure software ecosystem that strictly enforced Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) over financial data. The system needed to automate complex metallurgical calculations, eliminate data duplication, and provide a rapid Comparison Engine for the Product Development and Quality Control (PDQC) teams to evaluate R&D chemical variances.

**Methodology and Implementation:**
The project was executed following an Agile software development methodology adapted for enterprise industrial requirements. The system architecture employs a decoupled, full-stack Monorepo structure. The database layer utilizes a normalized relational model designed specifically to prevent data anomalies and maintain absolute referential integrity across all costing operations. Security was treated as a foundational requirement, implementing custom JSON Web Token (JWT) session management and granular RBAC to ensure that only authorized costing administrators could mutate base raw material rates.

**Technologies Utilized:**
The MCMS was built using a modern, scalable technology stack. The responsive frontend client was engineered with React 19 and TypeScript, utilizing Tailwind CSS v4 for rapid styling and Zustand for state management. The backend was powered by a Node.js and Express.js REST API. Persistent data storage was handled by PostgreSQL, with Prisma ORM acting as the robust database interaction layer. The entire application ecosystem was containerized using Docker, allowing for seamless deployment across JSW Steel’s internal production environments.

**Results:**
The deployed platform successfully met all stringent operational success criteria. The MCMS achieved zero calculation discrepancy, demonstrating exact mathematical parity with the verified legacy spreadsheets. Performance benchmarks were significantly exceeded, achieving dashboard load times under two seconds and API responses under 500 milliseconds. The system eradicates the risk of catastrophic financial miscalculations by enforcing immutable audit logging and access boundaries, ultimately empowering JSW Steel's executive leadership with real-time, highly agile cost analytics.

# Executive Summary

The **Metal Cost Management System (MCMS)** is an enterprise-grade industrial web application developed during a software engineering internship at **JSW Steel Ltd., Dolvi**. The project was initiated to resolve critical operational inefficiencies and mitigate severe financial risks associated with the Costing Department's legacy manual calculation processes.

**The Business Challenge**
JSW Steel manufactures thousands of specialized steel grades, each requiring precise chemical compositions of raw iron ore and expensive ferro-alloys. Because global metallurgical commodity prices are highly volatile, the exact manufacturing cost of each grade fluctuates constantly. Historically, these complex calculations were performed across decentralized, un-auditable spreadsheet models. This approach resulted in severe data fragmentation, vulnerability to formula corruption, lack of historical traceability, and slow response times during Research & Development (R&D) scenario planning.

**The Solution**
To address these challenges, the MCMS was engineered to serve as the definitive **Single Source of Truth (SSOT)** for all metallurgical costing operations. The platform digitizes and centralizes master data (Raw Materials, Base Costs, Steel Grades) and provides a real-time, immutable Calculation Engine.

Key features implemented include:
- **Calculation Workspace**: A dynamic environment where costing executives can build material compositions and instantly compute accurate production costs.
- **Comparison Engine**: A specialized analytical tool enabling the Product Development and Quality Control (PDQC) team to instantly evaluate chemical and financial variances across multiple steel grades.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Granular security policies ensuring that only authorized personnel can mutate sensitive raw material rates.
- **Immutable Audit Trails**: Automated background tracking of every data modification, guaranteeing regulatory compliance and historical transparency.

**Technical Implementation**
The system was architected using a modern, scalable full-stack Monorepo structure. The frontend utilizes **React 19**, **TypeScript**, and **Tailwind CSS v4** to deliver a responsive, industrial-themed dashboard. The backend is powered by a **Node.js/Express.js** REST API, ensuring high throughput and secure routing. Data persistence is managed by a normalized **PostgreSQL** database, interacted with via the **Prisma ORM** to enforce strict relational integrity. The entire platform was containerized using **Docker** for seamless production deployment.

**Business Value Delivered**
The deployment of the MCMS successfully eradicated the financial risks of decentralized calculation. By enforcing exact mathematical parity with legacy systems while introducing robust database constraints, the platform guarantees **zero calculation discrepancy**. It has drastically reduced the time required for PDQC scenario analysis, provided executive leadership with real-time financial visibility, and established a highly secure, auditable ecosystem for future industrial software expansion at JSW Steel.

## 1.1 Introduction

In the modern heavy manufacturing sector, particularly within integrated iron and steel production, cost management is not merely a retroactive accounting exercise; it is a real-time, deterministic parameter that directly governs operational viability, commercial bidding agility, and overall market competitiveness. The global steel industry operates in a hyper-competitive, high-volume environment characterized by thin profit margins. In an integrated steel plant, such as JSW Steel’s 10 MTPA coastal facility in Dolvi, Maharashtra, the financial viability of manufacturing operations is constantly exposed to the extreme price volatility of global raw materials.

Steel is not a singular commodity; rather, it is produced in thousands of distinct "grades" (e.g., structural carbon steels, automotive high-strength steels, specialized stainless steel alloys), each defined by strict metallurgical and chemical composition limits. Achieving these precise chemical recipes requires the controlled addition of base metals and highly expensive, globally traded ferro-alloys such as Silico Manganese, Ferro Chrome, Ferro Titanium, Ferro Nickel, and Ferro Vanadium. Because the market rates for these input materials fluctuate daily due to global supply chain dynamics, geopolitical factors, and market demand, the cost of producing a single metric tonne of any given steel grade is highly volatile.

To maintain profitability, metallurgical manufacturing requires a precise, dynamic, and automated costing mechanism. Metal cost management involves the systematic calculation, evaluation, and tracking of raw material costs, processing expenses, and chemical compositions. Inaccurate costing projections introduce catastrophic financial risks: overestimating costs leads to uncompetitive bids and lost business, while underestimating costs leads to unprofitable production runs that erode corporate capital. Consequently, establishing a robust, enterprise-grade cost management framework is a fundamental requirement for modern steelmakers seeking to optimize their product mix, manage procurement cycles, and execute profitable commercial contracts.

## 1.2 Background of the Project

Historically, JSW Steel’s Costing Department and production teams relied on decentralized, manual costing workflows built around Microsoft Excel spreadsheets. While these legacy tools offered initial flexibility for individual engineers, they introduced significant operational vulnerabilities, data fragmentation, and financial risks when scaled to an enterprise level. The legacy spreadsheet-based approach suffered from several systemic limitations:

1. **Fragmentation of Pricing Truth:** Sourcing and procurement teams negotiate raw material rates and contract terms with multiple suppliers, updating local spreadsheets. Production engineers, working in separate offices or departments, frequently calculated grade costs using outdated raw material prices, leading to inconsistencies in commercial quotes.
2. **IEEE 754 Floating-Point Precision Errors:** Standard spreadsheet software and default JavaScript engines perform mathematical calculations using binary floating-point representation. When evaluating complex chemical weight percentages across thousands of metric tonnes, microscopic rounding discrepancies aggregate into substantial financial errors.
3. **Absence of Immutable Audit Trails:** When a raw material price or tariff is modified in a live spreadsheet, all historical calculations referencing that cell dynamically recalculate. This behavior breaks the financial audit trail, making it impossible to trace the exact rates and coefficients active at the precise millisecond of a historic commercial clearance.
4. **Alloy Building and Simulation Bottlenecks:** Comparing the cost-efficiency of alternative chemical compositions under dynamic tariff and tax structures (such as varying GST slabs) required hours of manual manipulation. The lack of a side-by-side cost modeling workspace delayed procurement decisions and weakened JSW's market agility.

## 1.3 Existing System

### 1.3.1 Existing Manual Costing Workflow

The legacy metallurgical costing workflow at the JSW Steel Dolvi facility is highly decentralized, relying on manual data entry and offline file transfers across multiple departments. The process begins when the Sourcing and Procurement teams receive updated contract prices for base metals and ferro-alloys from suppliers. These rates are manually compiled into a master spreadsheet. Planners and metallurgical engineers then manually copy these rates into their individual grade calculation worksheets. After defining the chemical weight percentages and grade multipliers, the final cost is calculated and saved as a static local spreadsheet file, which is then emailed to finance managers for budget approvals.

### 1.3.2 Current Problems of the Legacy System

The manual, file-based costing workflow introduces several operational bottlenecks and financial risks:

- **Rate Inconsistency (Pricing Drift):** Because rates are distributed via static files, engineers frequently perform calculations using outdated rate sheets, leading to inconsistent and inaccurate commercial quotes.
- **Formula and Reference Vulnerability:** Shared spreadsheets lack structural protection; any user can accidentally alter formulas or overwrite cells, leading to silent calculation errors.
- **Floating-Point Rounding Inaccuracies:** Standard spreadsheet applications evaluate calculations using default binary floating-point representations, causing tiny rounding errors that accumulate into significant financial discrepancies during large-volume calculations.
- **Lack of Mutation Auditing:** There is no centralized system logging who updated a rate, when it was changed, or what the previous value was, leaving the organization vulnerable to internal compliance gaps.

## 1.4 Problem Statement

The absence of a centralized, secure, high-precision price evaluation workspace at the JSW Steel Dolvi costing facility leads to fragmented master rates, severe mathematical drift due to standard binary floating-point limitations, a complete lack of auditable calculations, and a high risk of formula corruption. To safeguard JSW Steel's commercial bidding margins and compliance standards, there is an immediate need to replace manual, file-based costing processes with a centralized digital platform that enforces mathematical precision, access controls, and immutable transaction histories.

## 1.5 Need for the Project

## 3.1 Introduction

The engineering of an enterprise industrial costing platform like the Metal Cost Management System (MCMS) requires a comprehensive review of established industrial practices, data modeling standards, and software security perimeters. This literature review evaluates the methodologies and architectural patterns that form the technical foundation of the MCMS.

This chapter examines the domain of industrial metal cost management, analyzing the distinct mathematical challenges of steel costing and the operational limits of legacy desktop applications. The subsequent sections explore database normalization patterns within Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems, spreadsheet-based costing constraints, and the research gaps that necessitated a custom solution.

## 3.2 Digital Transformation in Manufacturing

The steel industry is undergoing a digital transformation driven by Industry 4.0 principles, smart manufacturing, and cloud computing. This transformation aims to transition traditional mill operations away from legacy, paper-based, and manual tracking systems into interconnected, data-driven smart factories.

Modern integrated steel plants utilize IoT sensors, automated spectrometer analysis, and real-time telemetry to monitor production yields. Integrating digital cost management engines directly with these plant telemetry systems allows for immediate financial evaluations. As raw steel is tapped from the ladle, chemical composition data is automatically captured, enabling real-time cost-per-tonne assessments of the active batch.

A key requirement of Industry 4.0 is the establishment of digital workflows that replace email-based communication and physical logs. A digital workflow ensures version governance, operational security through verified user identities, and referential integrity to prevent the accidental deletion of linked active raw materials.

## 3.3 ERP Systems

Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems form the administrative backbone of modern industrial corporations, centralizing core business processes such as finance, human resources, procurement, and inventory management into a single, unified database. In heavy industries like steel manufacturing, ERP platforms serve as the transactional system of record, logging bulk material movements and invoice records.

While standard ERP platforms (such as SAP ERP or Oracle Cloud) excel at managing general ledger accounts and high-level inventory records, they often lack the mathematical granularity and performance speeds required for active metallurgical cost optimization. For example, calculating the cost of a steel grade based on fractional changes in ferro-alloy market prices requires instant, recursive mathematical recalculations. Conducting these complex calculations directly inside a legacy monolithic ERP database can introduce latency and degrade transactional performance.

To resolve this, modern industrial architectures utilize dedicated cost management microservices that run independently of the core ERP. These engines poll raw material pricing from the ERP database, execute high-speed scenario analyses, and then sync finalized cost values back into the ERP ledger.

## 3.4 Cost Management Systems

Industrial metal cost management is a specialized discipline within manufacturing economics, focused on the precise calculation of production expenses associated with refining and alloying metals. In steel manufacturing, costing is exceptionally complex because it is dictated by volatile global commodity prices, non-linear metallurgical compositions, and variable production yields.

Calculating the exact cost per metric tonne involves evaluating volatile ferro-alloy inputs, scrap and recovery valuations, and overhead energy tariffs. Traditional costing workflows have struggled with float precision limitations and pricing drift. Industrial Cost Management Software, whether part of standard ERP modules or built as custom web applications, seeks to formalize these calculations. 

Custom costing applications offer high customization tailored to the exact metallurgical equations of the host plant and provide real-time execution that enables fast calculations and instant side-by-side grade comparisons, overcoming the rigidness of standard ERP setups.

## 3.5 Spreadsheet-Based Costing

Spreadsheet-based costing remains the most common manual costing methodology in medium-to-large-scale manufacturing due to its simplicity and flexibility.

**Advantages:**
- **Low Barrier to Entry:** Requires no specialized training beyond basic formula syntax.
- **High Flexibility:** Allows domain experts to quickly construct ad-hoc calculators and swap variables.
- **Zero Infrastructure Cost:** Utilizes standard office software already licensed by the enterprise.

**Disadvantages:**
- **Float Precision Limitations:** Spreadsheets execute math via double-precision floating-point arithmetic (IEEE 754 standard). When compiling high-volume formulas, these float representations introduce small rounding errors that scale into significant financial discrepancies.
- **Data Fragmentation (Pricing Drift):** Local spreadsheet files lead to duplicate data across machines. Updates made in one sheet do not sync globally.
- **No Concurrency:** Local files cannot be concurrently modified by multiple stakeholders without version conflicts.
- **Zero Audit Trails:** Lacks automated logging of who modified a chemical constraint or unit cost.

## 3.6 Research Papers Review

Several academic and industrial studies have evaluated cost optimization models, activity-based costing (ABC), and database integrations within heavy metallurgical industries.

Research by Cooper and Kaplan established Activity-Based Costing as the standard for tracing overhead costs to specific manufacturing activities. In steel plants, applying ABC involves mapping energy consumption, furnace time, and alloy utilization to individual steel grades. However, as noted by Oh and Shin, classical ABC models are often implemented as static, retrospective auditing tools rather than real-time, interactive calculation systems.

Furthermore, linear programming and composition optimization models (such as those proposed by Dantzig) are widely used in steel-melting shops to determine the least-cost blend of scrap and ferro-alloys. While computationally robust, these mathematical models are often isolated from the organization's pricing directories, introducing human error and pricing delays.

## 3.7 Existing Solutions Comparison

The following table compares the main cost management methodologies across key enterprise parameters:

| Operational Parameter | Manual Excel Systems | Standard ERP (SAP/Oracle) | Custom Costing Applications |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Data Integrity** | Poor (vulnerable to formula corruption) | Excellent (strict referential constraints) | Excellent (relational constraints, type-safety) |
| **Calculation Velocity** | Manual / High latency | Batch processed / Medium latency | Real-time / Low latency (< 500ms) |
| **Arithmetic Precision** | Low (IEEE 754 float rounding errors) | Medium (fixed decimal limitations) | High (arbitrary-precision decimal math) |
| **Audit Compliance** | Poor (untraceable data mutations) | Excellent (transactional logging) | Excellent (custom immutable audit logging) |
| **User Concurrency** | Non-existent (document lockouts) | High (multi-user locking mechanisms) | High (web-based stateless connections) |
| **Customization Cost** | Zero (user-defined formulas) | High (requires specialized ERP consultants) | Medium (one-time developer engineering) |

## 3.8 Research Gap

Despite the progress in metallurgical optimization and enterprise ERP software, a significant gap remains in integrating real-time market rates with active chemical composition builders. Standard commercial systems present several key limitations:

1. **Isolation of Costing from Grade Design:** Procurement databases, metallurgical recipe models, and chemical constraints (min/max tolerances) are managed in siloed systems, leading to manual data transcription.
2. **Arithmetic Rounding Drift:** Standard enterprise platforms do not actively mitigate floating-point rounding errors at the application layer, which can cause significant discrepancies in high-tonnage cost sheets.
3. **Absence of Transaction Snapshots:** Commercial platforms typically overwrite rate histories or query live databases for historical calculations. This compromises auditable integrity, as a rate change in the master table retroactively alters the calculated costs of past receipts.

## 3.9 Proposed Solution

The Metal Cost Management System (MCMS) directly addresses these research and commercial gaps through a specialized full-stack architecture:

- **Centralized Rule-Based Schema:** It normalizes the relational database schema, mapping raw material market rates directly to grade-specific chemical constraints (Grade Builder).
- **Arbitrary-Precision Arithmetic:** It executes all mathematical calculations on the backend using `Decimal.js`, eliminating floating-point rounding drift.
- **Transaction Snapshot Pattern:** When a calculation is finalized, the system locks the exact input rates and recipe compositions as a JSON blob within the calculation record, ensuring historical auditability.

The operational differences highlight the superiority of the proposed solution for this specific use case, offering real-time recipe tuning, volatile rate integration without batch processing delays, arbitrary precision, and immutable historical auditing.

## 3.10 Chapter Summary

This chapter has reviewed the foundational academic and industrial literature underlying the engineering of the Metal Cost Management System (MCMS). By evaluating standard metallurgical costing practices, Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) integrations, and digital manufacturing workflows, this review has established the technical context for the platform.

### 3.10.1 Key Takeaways

- **Metallurgical Complexity:** Steel costing is heavily influenced by alloy price volatility and scrap yield recoveries, necessitating dynamic recipe calculation platforms.
- **Limitations of Spreadsheets:** Manual spreadsheet systems introduce compounding rounding anomalies due to double-precision floating-point arithmetic (IEEE 754) and lack central governance.
- **ERP Sidecar Architecture:** While core ERP systems like SAP manage transactional ledgers, they lack the speed and mathematical flexibility required for live, interactive costing simulation, indicating a need for a decoupled sidecar application.
- **The Research Gap:** Existing literature and commercial software lack a unified mechanism that links real-time chemical tolerances with arbitrary-precision mathematics (`Decimal.js`) and historical transaction snapshot storage.

### 3.10.2 Transition to Chapter 4

With the theoretical framework and research gaps established, the next phase of the project requires defining the precise engineering scope. Chapter 4 provides a detailed Requirement Analysis, specifying the functional, non-functional, and business rules that govern the MCMS codebase.

## 4.5 User Roles

The MCMS architecture leverages Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) configured at the database level to ensure data security and operational separation.

1. **COSTING_DEPARTMENT:** The primary operational users with full read-and-write permissions across the calculation workspace, metals directory, rates, and grade reports. They are responsible for executing the calculations and tracking raw material pricing.
2. **PDQC:** Users from Product Design & Quality Control with read-only access to material costs but write-access to the Grade Builder. They manage the chemical recipes and limits without affecting the underlying financial cost rates.

## 4.6 Software Requirements

The Metal Cost Management System (MCMS) is designed as a web-based client-server application. The software environment is standardized on a modern TypeScript stack to ensure modularity, cross-platform compatibility, and ease of maintenance.

## 4.7 Hardware Requirements

To guarantee high availability and meet the non-functional performance latency targets (< 500ms for calculations), the hosting infrastructure and client terminals must meet minimum and recommended hardware standards.

| Hardware Metric | Server Minimum Specs | Server Recommended Specs | Client Workstation Minimum | Client Workstation Recommended |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **CPU Architecture** | x86_64 or ARM64 | x86_64 or ARM64 | x86_64 or Apple Silicon | x86_64 or Apple Silicon |
| **Processor Cores** | 2 vCPUs | 4 vCPUs | Dual-Core 2.0 GHz | Quad-Core 2.5 GHz+ |

| **Network Interface** | 100 Mbps | 1 Gbps | 10 Mbps | 100 Mbps+ |

## 4.8 Business Rules

Business Rules (BR) represent the core logical constraints enforced by the MCMS calculation engine and database layer.

1. **BR-01: Calculation State Immutability:** Once a cost calculation is finalized and saved, its record becomes immutable. Any subsequent changes to raw material rates or grade compositions do not alter historical calculation snapshots.
2. **BR-02: Orphan Record Deletion Constraints:** Raw materials or steel grades that are linked to any active cost sheets or historical calculations cannot be deleted from the database. They must be archived or marked as inactive to maintain referential integrity.
3. **BR-03: Currency Standardization & Multi-currency Boundaries:** All cost inputs must adhere to standard unit measurements (e.g., USD/Tonne or INR/Tonne). The system performs calculations natively in the standardized base currency to prevent conversion-related drift.
4. **BR-04: Strict Composition Tolerances:** The sum of all target composition percentages in the Grade Builder must exactly equal 100%. Calculations will not execute if the material recipe fails this validation.

## 4.9 Use Cases

The following primary use cases define the interactions between stakeholders and the MCMS platform:

- **UC-01: Manage Raw Material Rates:** A Costing Administrator navigates to the Metals module and updates the base rate of a raw material. The system records the old rate, saves the new rate, and triggers an audit log entry.
- **UC-02: Build a Steel Grade Recipe:** A PDQC Engineer creates a new steel grade, specifies the chemical minimum/maximum constraints, and assigns percentage targets to raw materials until the composition reaches 100%.
- **UC-03: Execute Cost Calculation:** A Costing Administrator selects an active steel grade in the Calculation Workspace. The system dynamically pulls the current raw material rates and the grade recipe, computing the total cost per tonne in real-time.
- **UC-04: Compare Calculations:** An Executive Management user opens the Comparison Module, selects three saved calculation snapshots, and views a side-by-side matrix of their cost variances and chemical compositions.

## 4.10 Feasibility Study

Before executing the detailed design and implementation phases of the Metal Cost Management System (MCMS), a feasibility study is conducted to evaluate its viability across four core dimensions: Technical, Operational, Economic, and Schedule feasibility.

| Feasibility Dimension | Evaluation Criteria | Feasibility Rating | Strategic Resolution / Mitigation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Technical** | Tech stack compatibility, mathematical precision, database performance | **High** | Utilizes standard TypeScript stack with `Decimal.js` to ensure precision and type safety. |
| **Operational** | User adoption, role enforcement, organizational alignment | **High** | Implements a clean, ERP-style dashboard with RBAC mapping to existing plant user roles. |
| **Economic** | Development costs, licensing fees, operational cost savings | **High** | Uses open-source frameworks to avoid software licensing costs; reduces spreadsheet administration hours. |
| **Schedule** | Delivery timeline, parallel workflows, development milestones | **High** | Uses a monorepo layout for parallel client/server development to meet delivery targets. |

## 4.11 Risk Analysis

A proactive risk analysis identifies potential vulnerabilities in the deployment and operation of the MCMS, providing mitigation strategies to ensure system stability.

| Risk Category | Identified Risk | Impact Level | Mitigation Strategy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Data Integrity** | Floating-point rounding errors scaling in high-volume production cost calculations. | High | Implement `Decimal.js` for all backend arithmetic to enforce arbitrary-precision calculations. |
| **Security** | Unauthorized mutation of raw material rates or calculation logic. | High | Enforce strict Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) combined with immutable database audit logging. |

## 4.12 Chapter Summary

Chapter 4 has established the comprehensive requirements and constraints that guide the engineering of the Metal Cost Management System (MCMS). By defining the operational boundaries through functional and non-functional requirements, the platform is structured to deliver high-performance, secure, and mathematically precise cost calculations.

### 4.12.1 Key Takeaways

- **Stakeholder Alignment:** Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) ensures a clear separation of duties between Costing (rate management) and PDQC (recipe design).
- **Mathematical Precision:** Utilizing `Decimal.js` and enforcing calculation immutability (Transaction Snapshots) guarantees financial integrity and auditable history.
- **Modern Infrastructure:** The selection of a TypeScript/React/Node.js stack provides a scalable, cross-platform foundation that meets the low-latency targets required for real-time costing.
- **Feasibility and Risk Mitigation:** The project is highly feasible across technical and economic dimensions, with identified risks proactively mitigated through architectural choices (e.g., avoiding floating-point math).

### 4.12.2 Transition to Chapter 5

Having established what the system must accomplish, the next phase focuses on how it will be built. Chapter 5 details the System Analysis and Design, presenting the overarching architectural layout, the decoupled client-server interaction patterns, and the database schema design.

## 5.1 Existing System Workflow

Prior to the MCMS, cost management at JSW Steel Dolvi relied entirely on manual processes and spreadsheet-based (Excel) calculations. The existing workflow involved Costing Department analysts manually tracking volatile raw material and ferro-alloy prices through procurement invoices. When a calculation was needed, they would gather target chemical compositions from PDQC engineers (often communicated via email or printed documents), manually enter the market rates into an Excel workbook, and iteratively adjust the mixture weights to meet the chemical targets. 

This legacy process had significant technical limitations:
- Double-precision floating-point arithmetic (IEEE 754) in Excel led to minute rounding errors that compounded over bulk production tonnages.
- A lack of concurrency prevented multiple analysts from working simultaneously.
- Zero audit trails meant price mutations and recipe modifications could not be tracked back to a specific user.
- No historical transaction locking (snapshots) meant any update to a master rate sheet would retroactively alter past cost computations.

## 5.2 Proposed System Workflow

The Metal Cost Management System (MCMS) introduces a fully digital, database-backed workflow that mitigates legacy limitations:
1. **Material and Rate Management:** Costing Administrators register raw materials and update base prices. Price mutations are logged in a historical database rather than updating local spreadsheets.
2. **Grade Recipe Building:** PDQC Metallurgical Engineers log into the system to define target element tolerances (Min/Max percent) for commercial steel grades, decoupling chemical definitions from pricing operations.
3. **Calculation Execution:** Analysts select a grade and adjust input weights in the web UI. The system calculates chemical compliance and cost using arbitrary-precision arithmetic (`Decimal.js`), preventing float rounding errors.
4. **Historical Locking:** When saved, the system freezes the input rates and composition into a JSON snapshot, ensuring future market price changes do not corrupt auditable historical records.
5. **Comparison & Export:** Executives and analysts can select multiple snapshots to compare cost variances side-by-side or export formatted PDF/Excel reports instantly.

## 5.3 System Architecture

The MCMS is engineered as a decoupled, client-server web application organized within a monorepo workspace. This decoupled structure separates client-side interface rendering from backend calculation execution, ensuring that high-volume database queries and costing computations do not degrade the client user experience.

- **Presentation Layer (Frontend):** A React 19 single-page application (SPA) built using Vite and styled with Tailwind CSS.
- **Backend API Layer (Express.js):** A lightweight, asynchronous REST API running on Node.js and written in TypeScript. 
- **Business Logic Layer (Costing Engine):** Executes all metallurgical cost sheet calculations using `Decimal.js` to ensure arbitrary-precision arithmetic.
- **Data Access Layer (Prisma ORM):** Prisma client acts as the ORM, translating backend TypeScript interface calls into optimized SQL queries.
- **Database Layer (PostgreSQL):** A relational PostgreSQL database instance serving as the single source of truth.

## 5.4 Frontend Architecture

The frontend of the Metal Cost Management System (MCMS) is designed as a modular React single-page application (SPA). This client-side architecture focuses on responsive performance, real-time feedback during recipe formulation, and role-adapted layouts.

- **Vite Build Pipeline:** Provides high-speed bundlers enabling hot module replacement (HMR).
- **React Component Hierarchy:** The UI utilizes reusable UI blocks, including a universal sidebar, dashboard statistics cards, interactive rate grids, and dynamic calculation grids.
- **Client-Side Routing:** Managed by React Router, with protected route wrappers that verify authentication states and restrict route visibility.
- **State Management:** Uses Zustand for transient application state (sidebar toggles, active calculation forms) and TanStack Query for server-side state synchronization (caching and background refetching).
- **Service Client Directory:** Axios-based HTTP clients communicate with the backend, automatically injecting JWTs into Authorization headers.

## 5.5 Backend Architecture

The backend of the MCMS is built using Node.js and Express in TypeScript. It is designed to be stateless, highly performant, and secure, ensuring that mathematical calculations and database writes are executed reliably.

- **Express Router & Middleware:** Routes requests and enforces security through JWT authentication middleware, Role-verification middleware, and Zod input validation schemas.
- **Controller Layer:** Parses HTTP request variables and delegates business logic to dedicated service layers, returning structured JSON payloads.
- **Service Layer (Business Logic):** Houses the core business rules. The `CalculationService` implements costing formulas using `Decimal.js`, while the `AuditService` records immutable audit trails.
- **Data Access Layer (Prisma ORM):** Executes database queries using Prisma Client, wrapping complex operations (like saving a calculation and its audit log) in SQL transactions to ensure atomic execution.

## 5.6 Database Architecture

The MCMS utilizes a PostgreSQL relational database. Relational databases are highly suited for manufacturing ERP applications because they enforce strict database schemas, prevent orphaned data records (e.g., deleting a raw material that is currently linked to an active grade composition recipe), and support ACID transactional properties. 

To maintain high performance under concurrent requests, the Express backend manages database connections using Prisma ORM's connection pooler. The connection pooler reuses active sockets rather than opening a new database socket for every incoming API request. The Prisma client compiles type-safe SQL statements and runs operations within database transactions.

## 5.7 Authentication Architecture

The MCMS authentication system enforces strict Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to ensure that only authorized personnel can view or mutate financial data. The system uses JWT-based authentication for identity management. The authentication protocol is built around stateless JSON Web Tokens (JWT). When a user logs in, they receive a digitally signed cryptographic token (JWT) containing their user ID, email, and assigned role.

Subsequent HTTP requests from the React client include this token in the `Authorization: Bearer <JWT>` header. The Express backend validates the token's digital signature locally using a shared secret key, verifying the user's identity without requiring a database query to the auth server for every request.

## 5.8 Role-Based Access Control

The application validates the role payload embedded inside the decrypted JWT against route-specific authorization rules:
- **COSTING_DEPARTMENT:** Full CRUD privileges. Users can edit raw material base rates, execute costing workspaces, configure system parameters, and modify user roles.
- **PDQC:** Read-only access to material costs and dashboards; full write-access to the Grade Builder panel to edit chemical ingredient ranges.

## 5.9 Data Flow Diagrams

## 5.15 System Workflow

The integrated system workflow unifies the individual process modules (Authentication, Role Verification, Form Data Input, Mathematical Service execution, Document Generation, and Database Transactions) into a cohesive digital cycle. From the initial login via JWT handshake, users traverse protected React Router paths to modify pricing variables or execute cost formulas. The frontend client leverages optimistic caching via TanStack Query to keep the UI fluid while Express routes relay calculation payloads to backend computational services securely.

## 5.16 Chapter Summary

This chapter detailed the system analysis and design parameters that establish the technical foundation of the Metal Cost Management System (MCMS). The system architecture relies on a decoupled, client-server monorepo workspace split into a React 19 presentation layer and a NodeJS/Express business service layer, bridged by the Prisma ORM to a relational PostgreSQL database instance. Transaction workflows were specified for material price updates, grade configurations, cost workspace computations, side-by-side comparison matrices, and reporting exports. Functional interactions and data routing pathways were modeled through comprehensive UML diagrams and Data Flow Diagrams.

### 5.16.1 Key Takeaways
- **Decoupled Architecture:** Separating React presentation from server-side costing math protects client performance from complex queries and database tasks.
- **Arbitrary-Precision Safeguards:** Standardizing costing calculations on `Decimal.js` prevents floating-point rounding drifts, ensuring 100% mathematical auditability.
- **Transaction Snapshot Integrity:** Locking active pricing configurations directly into JSON snapshot blobs guarantees historical calculations remain immutable when master rate tables are updated.
- **Role-Based Security Gates:** Integrating JWT validators allows the system to enforce role scopes at the server API layer.

### 5.16.2 Transition to Chapter 6

The technical workflows, data flows, and system components analyzed in this chapter depend on a normalized, high-performance database schema to ensure relational safety and low-latency response times. To establish these specifications, Chapter 6 detailing the database design focuses on normalization structures, entity-relationship attributes, data constraints, table indexes, and structural Prisma definitions that map these designs into type-safe source code.

## 6.1 Database Overview

The database architecture is the backbone of the Metal Cost Management System (MCMS), responsible for securely storing user profiles, material prices, grade specifications, and historical cost calculations. To achieve high data integrity, transactional reliability, and seamless horizontal scaling, the system leverages **PostgreSQL**, an advanced open-source Object-Relational Database Management System (ORDBMS).

PostgreSQL was selected as the primary data store due to its robust support for ACID transactions, referential integrity, and advanced data types. Specifically, the MCMS relies heavily on arbitrary JSON structures to freeze calculation states (snapshots) and store dynamic metallurgical properties. PostgreSQL's native `JSONB` data type allows the system to combine the structured rigor of a relational database with the schema-less flexibility of a NoSQL document store.

## 6.2 ER Diagram

## 6.3 Database Schema

The MCMS database schema defines a highly normalized relational structure mapped securely through Prisma to PostgreSQL. The architecture segregates responsibilities into domain-specific clusters: identity management, metallurgical master data, costing execution, snapshot records, and operational telemetry.

| Domain | Implemented Tables | Primary Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Identity & Config** | `User`, `SystemSetting`, `GstSlab`, `JswProductCatalog` | RBAC authentication, app configuration, tax rates. |
| **Master Material** | `RawMaterial`, `MaterialCategory`, `MaterialSupplier`, `MaterialRate`, `MaterialPriceHistory`, `MaterialAuditLog` | Base materials, active rates, and pricing historical logs. |
| **Legacy Metals** | `Metal`, `Supplier`, `PriceList`, `PriceHistory`, `Alloy`, `AlloyComponent` | Legacy mappings for metal types and rigid alloy definitions. |
| **Steel Grades** | `Grade`, `GradeMaterial`, `GradeVersion`, `GradeHistory`, `GradeValidationLog`, `MechanicalProperty`, `ChemicalProperty` | Dynamic steel definitions, physical limits, and versioning. |
| **Costing Engine** | `Calculation`, `CalculationItem` | Workspace cost sheets, arbitrary math outputs, JSON snapshots. |
| **Comparison** | `ComparisonSession`, `ComparisonItem`, `ComparisonResult`, `ComparisonSnapshot`, `ComparisonNote`, `ComparisonHistory`, `ComparisonExport`, `ComparisonPreference` | Side-by-side matrices, variance analysis, and saved metrics. |
| **Telemetry** | `AuditLog`, `Notification`, `Report` | Action tracing, async alerts, and PDF/Excel export queues. |

## 6.4 Table Structure

The following sections document the specific schema rules, columns, data types, and constraints for the core implemented system models.

### 6.4.1 Identity & System Operations
- **User (`profiles`)**: Manages enterprise accounts and RBAC access logic. `id` (UUID), `name` (String), `email` (String), `department` (Enum), `role` (String), `status` (String).
- **SystemSetting**: Key/value store for runtime application flags. `id` (UUID), `key` (String), `value` (String).

### 6.4.2 Core Materials & Pricing
- **RawMaterial (`master_materials`)**: Central entity for base commodities. `id` (UUID), `materialCode` (String), `currentRate` (Decimal 16,4).
- **MaterialRate**: Tracks active and scheduled pricing limits. `id` (UUID), `rate` (Decimal 16,4), `effectiveFrom` (DateTime).

### 6.4.3 Steel Grades & Metallurgy
- **Grade**: Defines functional parameters and statuses for produced steel. `id` (UUID), `name` (String), `status` (String).
- **GradeMaterial**: Junction table mapping specific materials to a Grade (Recipe). `compositionPercent` (Decimal 7,4), `quantityKg` (Decimal 16,4).

### 6.4.4 Costing Workspace
- **Calculation**: Stores active workspaces, math results, and frozen rates. `id` (UUID), `batchId` (String), `finalCost` (Decimal 18,4), `snapshot` (JSON).
- **CalculationItem**: Stores individual line-item material contributions to a total batch. `id` (UUID), `quantity` (Decimal 16,4), `snapshot` (JSON).

## 6.5 Relationships

All models implement universally unique identifiers (UUIDv4) as primary keys (`@id`) to eliminate sequence prediction attacks. Foreign keys explicitly link related records, ensuring that database queries can traverse seamlessly across domain layers.

| Source Entity | Target Entity | Multiplicity | Foreign Key | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `User` | `Calculation` | One-to-Many | `userId` | A user can create and own multiple saved costing sheets. |
| `Grade` | `GradeMaterial` | One-to-Many | `gradeId` | A single steel grade requires an array of raw material inputs. |
| `Grade` | `MechanicalProperty` | One-to-One | `gradeId` | Each grade maps strictly to one rigid set of engineering specifications. |
| `Calculation` | `CalculationItem` | One-to-Many | `calculationId` | A cost sheet contains multiple line items for aggregated math operations. |
| `ComparisonSession` | `ComparisonItem` | One-to-Many | `comparisonSessionId` | A session aggregates multiple grades into a side-by-side array. |

## 6.6 Constraints

Relational databases secure data integrity by denying invalid transaction operations. The MCMS PostgreSQL configuration enforces strict constraints to prevent orphan rows and duplicate records.

- **Cascading Deletion Rules:** Cascading rules define the operational behavior when a parent row is deleted. For example, deleting a `Calculation` cascades down and permanently destroys all associated `CalculationItem` records.
- **Unique Constraints:** The schema defines exact-match bounds using `@unique` (e.g. `User.email`, `RawMaterial.materialCode`) and `@@unique` (e.g. `[gradeId, materialId]` in `GradeMaterial`) indices.

## 6.7 Indexing Strategy

Optimizing database access is critical for maintaining an industrial dashboard interface with latencies under 2 seconds. The PostgreSQL database utilizes native B-tree indices on heavily filtered columns to bypass full table scans during report generation. Prisma automatically provisions primary key and unique constraint indices. However, specific relational access paths heavily utilized in analytical queries are augmented, such as Composite Grades indices to optimize batch querying for Grade Builder validation.

## 6.8 Normalization

The schema is normalized to the **Third Normal Form (3NF)** to eliminate data redundancy.
1. **1NF:** All attributes are atomic (e.g., UUID primary keys, decimal values).
2. **2NF:** Partial dependencies are removed. Material details are separated from dynamic supplier lists.
3. **3NF:** Transitive dependencies are isolated. Calculations reference `userId` and `gradeId` rather than duplicating the user's name or the grade's physical traits on every cost sheet.

*Exception:* To preserve historical integrity, calculation records purposefully violate normalization by embedding a flat `snapshot` JSON object. This ensures old calculations reflect the material prices *at the exact time of creation*, rather than dynamically recalculating using modern prices.

## 6.9 Prisma ORM

To bridge the gap between the object-oriented Node.js runtime and the relational database, MCMS utilizes **Prisma ORM**. Prisma was selected over raw SQL or traditional ORMs due to its auto-generated, type-safe client and highly declarative `schema.prisma` architecture. Prisma ensures that if a database column changes, the TypeScript compiler immediately flags related errors in the backend codebase, eliminating runtime SQL query failures.

## 6.10 Migration Strategy

The application avoids manual SQL mutation scripts. Every schema evolution is hashed and tracked via `prisma migrate dev`. This generates strict, idempotent migration logs that enforce a single source of truth across the development, staging, and production environments. Complex write operations are executed within Prisma `$transaction` blocks. If any single insertion fails, the entire transaction rolls back, preventing orphaned or mathematically incomplete recipes from polluting the database.

## 6.11 Chapter Summary

Chapter 6 established the rigid architectural foundation of the MCMS database infrastructure. By implementing PostgreSQL paired with the Prisma ORM, the system successfully guarantees transactional safety, strict type-checking, and data immutability for enterprise reporting.

### 6.11.1 Key Takeaways
- **Highly Normalized Relational Design:** Distinct tables manage the core application domains without data redundancy.
- **Strategic Denormalization via JSONB:** Calculation snapshots freeze dynamic variables permanently to prevent historic price drift.
- **Transaction Atomicity:** Complex configurations are shielded from orphan corruption via Prisma `$transaction` pipelines.
- **Primary Security & Integrity:** UUIDv4 primary keys and Zod-enforced schema validations completely eliminate ID collision and dirty insertions.

### 6.11.2 Transition to Chapter 7

With the foundational data structures and relational bounds established, the platform requires an interface and logic layer capable of serving these complex data pipelines to the end-user. Chapter 7 (Technology Stack) explores the specific frameworks—React 19, Express, Node.js, and specialized libraries like Decimal.js—selected to drive the system’s computation engine and client experience.

With the system requirements, relational database schemas, and full-stack technology selections established in preceding chapters, this chapter examines the physical source code implementation of the JSW Metal Cost Management System (MCMS). The implementation strictly adheres to enterprise software engineering principles: Separation of Concerns (SoC), Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY), and strict type-safety. By structuring the codebase into modular layers, MCMS achieves high maintainability, rapid testability, and deterministic mathematical execution.

## 8.1 Authentication Module

Security and session governance within MCMS are anchored by a hybrid authentication architecture combining JSON Web Tokens (JWT) with a custom Express middleware pipeline.

- **JWT Session Management**: When a user logs into the platform, the backend authenticates credentials against stored cryptographic hashes (using `bcrypt` with a 12-round work factor) and generates a signed RS256 JWT access token.
- **Token Transport**: The client stores the JWT session securely and attaches it to every outgoing Axios HTTP request using the `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header envelope.
- **Server-Side Verification**: Upon receiving a request, the `authenticate` middleware extracts the token and verifies its cryptographic signature without requiring local database hits for basic token parsing.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Backend endpoint protection is implemented via a higher-order `allowRoles(...roles: string[])` middleware generator. If the authenticated actor's role (e.g., `COSTING_DEPARTMENT` or `PDQC`) is not authorized, the request is immediately aborted with a `403 Forbidden` response.

## 8.2 Dashboard

The Dashboard Module serves as the operational command center of MCMS, providing role-tailored real-time telemetry, executive KPI summary cards, statistical analytics charts, and recent activity audit streams.

- **Admin Dashboard**: Aggregates system-wide statistics including total calculations executed across all plant units, active alloy counts, active raw material pricing tiers, and registered user accounts.
- **User Dashboard**: Scoped specifically to the authenticated actor, highlighting personal calculation counts, user-created alloy recipes, and draft activity.
- **Interactive Visualizations**: The UI layer leverages `recharts` to render Key Performance Indicator (KPI) cards, 7-day calculation trend series, and composition breakdown pie charts.

## 8.3 Material Management

The Material Management module orchestrates the lifecycle operations of the master raw material catalog.

- **Material Provisioning**: Restricted to Costing Administrators, this function registers new industrial materials by specifying unique material codes, names, categories, and base units of measurement.
- **Status Toggling & Soft Deletion**: Deactivates material availability without deleting historical records, preserving calculation integrity for legacy steel grades.
- **Zod Validation**: Before reaching the database service layer, all incoming material mutation requests pass through strict Zod validation schemas to ensure data conformity.

## 8.4 Material Rate Management

Material Rate Management governs procurement market pricing, rate revision lifecycle flows, and historical volatility tracking across all base metals and raw materials.

- **Real-Time Price Updates**: Authorized Costing Specialists submit rate adjustments. The service computes exact price deltas and percentage shifts.
- **Volatility Warnings**: If a price shift exceeds a predefined threshold (e.g., 20%), the system flags the response payload with a warning indicator, prompting client-side confirmation modals to prevent accidental data entry errors.
- **Transactional Persistence**: Price updates execute an atomic `prisma.$transaction` that updates the current material rate, inserts an immutable historical record into the price history tables, logs the action in the audit trail, and deactivates the previous temporal rate.

## 8.5 Grade Builder

The Grade Builder workspace allows Quality Control specialists and Costing Admins to construct and validate multi-component steel formulations.

- **Grade Provisioning**: Defines base steel attributes including steel category, sub-grade classification, target batch production quantity, and mechanical/chemical property bounds.
- **Metallurgical Validation**: Before a grade recipe is submitted, it must pass automated validation checks, ensuring the sum of constituent percentages equals exactly 100%, no raw material is duplicated, and all constituents possess positive locked procurement rates.
- **Version Snapshotting**: Publishing a grade creates an immutable version snapshot (`GradeVersion`), guaranteeing historical auditability even if underlying material rates subsequently change.

## 8.6 Recipe Builder

The Recipe Builder works in tandem with the Grade Builder to manage the specific raw material constituent percentages and additive weights for a given steel grade.

- **Dynamic Recipe Composition**: Enables real-time tuning of the bill of materials for any given formulation.
- **Modification Constraints**: Recipe modifications are strictly restricted to grades in `DRAFT` or `ACTIVE` states. Submitted or approved recipes are immutably locked against direct alteration to prevent unauthorized margin adjustments on the factory floor.
- **Cloning & Iteration**: The system supports atomic cloning of existing grade recipes into new draft versions, seamlessly copying all child composition items and mechanical specifications for rapid iteration.

## 8.7 Cost Calculation Workspace

The Cost Calculation Workspace represents the central operational module of MCMS, integrating raw material selection, dynamic recipe configuration, and real-time costing execution.

- **Arbitrary-Precision Arithmetic**: To eliminate floating-point rounding errors during high-tonnage calculations, MCMS enforces strict 18-digit arbitrary precision using the `Decimal.js` library.
- **Mathematical Execution**: The calculation engine processes inputs through sequential evaluation phases: computing base materials cost (sum of weight × rate), additives cost, financial adjustments (flat additions vs. percentage surcharges), and ultimately total cost and unit cost per kilogram.
- **Live Summary Panel**: The client workspace features a persistent right-hand reactive drawer that updates continuously as inputs change, rendering instant cost breakdowns without requiring full-page reloads.

## 8.8 Comparison Module

The Comparison Module provides industrial engineers with multi-grade benchmarking tools, evaluating physical cost variances and chemical composition deltas against baseline steel grades.

- **Benchmarking Logic**: Compares JSON property blobs across raw material recipes and mechanical properties, calculating exact differential deltas relative to a designated reference baseline.
- **Similarity Scoring**: Evaluates a normalized similarity score by computing the Euclidean distance across key mechanical properties (e.g., Ultimate Tensile Strength and Yield Strength).
- **Analytical Visualizations**: Renders side-by-side comparative graphs and variance radar charts displaying financial cost deltas and metallurgical strength profiles.

## 8.9 Reports Module

The Reports Module aggregates operational datasets into executive analytics formats for compliance auditing and financial review.

- **Query Scopes**: Supports strict data filtering by date ranges, user scopes, and material status.
- **Paginated Indexing**: Enforces mandatory offset-based pagination to restrict result sets and maintain rapid API responsiveness during large analytical queries.
- **Visual Analytics Integration**: Translates raw database telemetry into formatted on-screen tables before dispatching them to the document generation microservices.

## 8.10 Export Module

The Export Module is a dedicated microservice facilitating the translation of application data into printable executive artifacts.

- **PDF Generation**: Generates vector PDF documents using `PDFKit`, incorporating corporate branding, dynamic page numbering, formatted financial tables, and summary footers.
- **Excel Generation**: Constructs multi-sheet spreadsheet workbooks using `ExcelJS`, applying custom column width calculations and currency format strings.
- **CSV Security Hardening**: Builds streamable CSV text streams with built-in defenses against CSV Formula Injection attacks by automatically escaping values starting with `=, +, -, @`.

## 8.11 User Management

User Management provides lifecycle administration for plant accounts, driven by Costing Administrators.

- **Account Provisioning**: Admins provision user accounts by assigning roles (`COSTING_DEPARTMENT` or `PDQC`), plant departments, and email credentials.
- **Access Revocation**: Supports instant account deactivation and lockout. This disables user access immediately without deleting historical calculation records, preserving relational integrity across the audit trail.

## 8.12 Audit Logs

Compliance and industrial traceability require complete audit telemetry across all data modifications in MCMS.

- **Asynchronous Telemetry**: To ensure security logging never delays API response times, the audit service executes asynchronously (fire-and-forget) without blocking HTTP response handlers.
- **Comprehensive Traceability**: Logs capture the user ID, executed action (e.g., `PRICE_CHANGE`, `GRADE_PUBLISHED`), target entity, IP address, and custom JSON metadata payloads detailing the exact modification.
- **Audit Inquiry**: Provides full-text search and pagination interfaces for compliance officers to inspect operational history across the platform.

## 8.13 Notifications

The Notifications module provides real-time event-driven alerts across active client sessions.

- **Server-Sent Events (SSE)**: Leverages an in-process event bus using Node.js `EventEmitter` to push real-time notifications (such as price volatility alerts or grade approval notices) directly to connected users.
- **Client Synchronization**: The frontend dynamically updates unread notification counters and renders toast alerts without requiring manual browser refreshes.

## 8.14 Settings

System Settings manage global operational parameters stored persistently within the PostgreSQL database.

- **Volatility Thresholds**: Defines the global percentage bounds (e.g., 20%) that trigger material rate price warnings.
- **Maintenance Operations**: Toggles global system read-only locks during database migrations or maintenance windows.
- **Taxation Rules**: Manages dynamic default taxation rules, such as applicable GST slabs for different material categories.

## 8.15 Implementation Challenges

During the physical construction of MCMS, several complex architectural challenges were successfully resolved:

- **Floating-Point Precision Loss**: Standard JavaScript IEEE 754 arithmetic caused cumulative rounding errors in high-tonnage calculations. This was resolved by universally migrating all mathematical execution layers to `Decimal.js` for arbitrary-precision formulations.
- **Stale Data Presentation**: In a multi-user environment, ensuring clients displayed current raw material prices was challenging. Implementing `@tanstack/react-query` with optimized stale-while-revalidate caching and background refetching ensured high UI responsiveness while maintaining data accuracy.
- **Cross-Boundary Contract Mismatches**: Keeping API request payloads in sync between the React client and Express backend was error-prone. Migrating to a pnpm monorepo structure with shared TypeScript interface packages and strict Zod validation schemas guaranteed end-to-end type safety.
- **Performance Under Load**: Complex multi-table transactions (e.g., price history updates paired with audit logs) threatened to block the Node.js event loop. Delegating non-critical telemetry to asynchronous fire-and-forget functions ensured API latencies remained well below the 500ms target.

## 8.16 Chapter Summary

Chapter 8 provided an exhaustive technical exposition of the system implementation of the JSW Metal Cost Management System. The chapter systematically detailed the execution of ten core industrial modules spanning authentication, role-based governance, multi-grade composition builders, arbitrary-precision calculation engines, and multi-format document generation pipelines.

### 8.16.1 Key Takeaways
- **Arbitrary Precision Mathematics**: Standard floating-point arithmetic is unusable in industrial costing; enforcing arbitrary precision guarantees zero financial drift across enterprise operations.
- **Decoupled Decisive Architecture**: Decoupling client UI stores from server calculation engines ensures UI responsiveness while maintaining strict backend authority over mathematical outcomes.
- **Defense-in-Depth Security**: Combining JWT verification, Zod schema validation, role-based middleware, non-blocking audit logging, and ACID database transactions establishes a resilient enterprise-grade security posture.

### 8.16.2 Transition to Chapter 9

Having thoroughly documented the concrete system implementation and module code structures, the report transitions to Chapter 9 (API Design). Chapter 9 inspects the RESTful network contracts, HTTP endpoint specifications, payload envelopes, request lifecycle security middleware chains, and session hardening mechanisms governing client-server communication across the MCMS platform.

## 9.1 REST API Overview

The JSW Metal Cost Management System (MCMS) backend exposes a comprehensive RESTful API built on Node.js and Express.js. All API endpoints are mounted under the `/api` prefix and communicate strictly via JSON payloads (`application/json`).

The API architecture is designed for high availability, security, and traceability. It enforces strict separation of concerns, decoupling network routing from business logic through the Router-Controller-Service pattern. Express routers delegate validated HTTP requests to controllers, which invoke stateless domain services that interface with the Prisma ORM. Every request is processed through a unified middleware chain that enforces security, authentication, role-based access control, and asynchronous telemetry logging.

## 9.2 Authentication APIs

Authentication is handled via JWT integration. The `/api/auth` endpoints manage session lifecycles, offloading cryptographic verification to the `auth.ts` middleware.

| Method | Endpoint | Access | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `POST` | `/api/auth/login` | Public | Authenticates credentials and issues JWT session tokens. Protected by `express-rate-limit`. |
| `POST` | `/api/auth/refresh` | Public | Refreshes expired access tokens using secure refresh tokens. |
| `POST` | `/api/auth/logout` | Authenticated | Terminates the active session and revokes tokens. |
| `GET` | `/api/auth/me` | Authenticated | Retrieves the authenticated actor profile and RBAC permissions. |
| `PUT` | `/api/auth/profile` | Authenticated | Updates the active user's profile metadata. |

## 9.3 Material APIs

The Material Master API governs raw material cataloging and pricing histories. It utilizes role-based safeguards (`COSTING_DEPARTMENT`) for mutation endpoints.

| Method | Endpoint | Access | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `GET` | `/api/materials` | Authenticated | Paginated retrieval of material masters. |
| `POST` | `/api/materials` | `COSTING_DEPARTMENT` | Provisions a new raw material master record. |

| `GET` | `/api/exports/csv` | Authenticated | Streams sanitized CSV files, guarding against formula injection. |

## 9.8 Validation

To prevent malformed data from reaching the database, request validation is enforced at the controller boundaries using **Zod**. Zod schemas strictly define the structure, types, and constraints of incoming payloads.

If validation fails, the `errorHandler` intercepts the `ZodError` and returns a detailed `issues` array specifying the exact fields that violated constraints.

## 9.9 Error Handling

The MCMS backend implements a unified error-handling architecture ensuring that client applications receive predictable, structured responses and that the server avoids fatal crashes. The core of this architecture is the `ApiError` class and the centralized `errorHandler` middleware.

- **`asyncRoute` Wrapper:** All asynchronous route handlers are wrapped to automatically catch Promise rejections and forward them to the `next()` middleware, preventing unhandled rejection crashes.
- **Centralized Middleware:** The `errorHandler` intercepts `ZodError` (returning 400 Bad Request with field-level issues), `ApiError` (returning custom HTTP statuses), and native exceptions (returning 500 Internal Server Error).
- **Database Error Parsing:** The handler identifies Prisma query errors and sanitizes the output before returning a 500 status to prevent database schema exposure.

## 9.10 API Security

The API implements a robust, defense-in-depth security posture designed for enterprise environments.

- **Helmet Middleware:** Injected into the Express pipeline to automatically set HTTP response headers protecting against cross-site scripting (XSS), clickjacking, and sniffing attacks.
- **Rate Limiting (`express-rate-limit`):** Applied to high-risk endpoints. For example, `/api/auth/login` is strictly limited to 10 requests per minute per IP to mitigate brute-force credential stuffing.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** The `allowRoles` middleware acts as a gatekeeper on routes. It verifies the injected `req.actor.role` and returns a `403 Forbidden` if the role lacks authorization, preventing privilege escalation.
- **JWT Verification:** The `authenticate` middleware extracts the Bearer token and verifies its cryptographic signature against the authentication service before attaching the actor context to the request.
- **CSV Formula Injection Defense:** The exports module sanitizes cell values starting with `=, +, -, @` by prepending a single quote `'`, preventing spreadsheet software from executing malicious payloads.

## 9.11 Chapter Summary

Chapter 9 detailed the RESTful API design, network contracts, and security architecture powering the MCMS backend. The chapter mapped the request lifecycle from initial client invocation through a hardened middleware chain encompassing rate limiting, JWT verification, and RBAC validation.

By analyzing the API endpoint matrices across Authentication, Materials, Grades, Calculations, and Reports, the chapter established how decoupled domain services orchestrate complex transactions. Furthermore, the unified error-handling framework and strict Zod schema validation ensure system stability and data integrity, safeguarding the platform against injection and privilege escalation attacks.

## 10.1 Testing Strategy

The Metal Cost Management System (MCMS) implements a comprehensive three-tier Quality Assurance (QA) methodology ensuring reliability, precision, and security across the enterprise platform. The testing pyramid is structured into Unit Testing, Integration Testing, and End-to-End (E2E) Browser Testing.

The primary objectives of the testing phase are to guarantee:
1. **Mathematical Precision**: Validating that all 18-digit arbitrary precision calculations performed by `Decimal.js` produce zero floating-point drift.
2. **Security & Authorization**: Verifying that Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) securely gates API endpoints.
3. **Workflow Resilience**: Ensuring the Calculation Workspace and Dashboard remain highly responsive under load.

<div align="center"><b>Figure 10.1</b>: Automated Testing & Validation Pipeline</div>

## 10.2 Unit Testing

Unit tests are executed using **Vitest**, providing a fast, Vite-native testing environment compatible with modern ES modules and TypeScript. Backend business logic is isolated and tested in `apps/backend/src/tests/`. Dependencies such as the Prisma ORM and JWT Auth APIs are mocked to ensure zero external network dependencies during execution.

Given MCMS's core identity as a financial costing application, testing calculation precision is paramount. The testing suite asserts that floating-point anomalies do not occur during complex metallurgical computations involving varying yields, recoveries, and conversion costs. The `Decimal.js` evaluations are stress-tested against thousands of randomized fractional permutations to guarantee exact parity with existing legacy offline calculators.

## 10.3 Integration Testing

Integration tests verify the combined functionality of different units. For example, testing the data flow between the API controllers and the database layer. In MCMS, this involves ensuring that `PrismaClient` correctly saves complex JSON snapshot states of the costing workspace into PostgreSQL without losing precision or structural integrity.

## 10.4 API Testing

The backend validation matrices assert the stability of network boundaries:
- API requests lacking a valid `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header immediately throw a `401 Unauthorized` exception.
- Expired or malformed JWTs throw structured `ApiError` instances.
- Zod schema validation correctly intercepts malformed payloads and returns `400 Bad Request` with an array of issues before the payload reaches the controller.

## 10.5 UI Testing

Frontend UI tests reside in `apps/frontend/src/tests/` alongside components (e.g., `WorkspacePage.test.tsx`, `EnterpriseDataTable.test.tsx`). Using `@testing-library/react` and `jsdom`, components are mounted in isolation to verify:
- DOM rendering and accessibility compliance (ARIA labels).
- User event handling (clicks, inputs, TanStack table sorting).
- Zustand global state mutation tracking.

To validate the complete user experience, **Playwright** is utilized to script and automate End-to-End (E2E) browser interactions. The E2E scripts launch headless browsers to simulate workflows like authenticating, configuring a complex metal composition, and saving a snapshot.

## 10.6 Security Testing

Security testing is heavily integrated into the unit testing phase. It asserts that endpoints guarded by the `allowRoles(["COSTING_DEPARTMENT"])` middleware successfully reject `403 Forbidden` for users operating under the `PDQC` role, ensuring strict multi-tenant authorization isolation. Furthermore, it validates that CSV injection vectors (using `=` or `@`) are sanitized during document export.

## 10.7 Performance Testing

While standard functional testing validates correctness, performance profiling ensures enterprise scalability. Strategies include:
- **TanStack Query Caching:** Verifying that repeated client navigation between the Dashboard and Workspace does not trigger duplicate `GET` requests, saving database egress costs.
- **Database Connection Pooling:** Verifying that rapid sequential Prisma operations utilize the connection pool.
- **Client Render Profiling:** Utilizing React Profiler to identify and eliminate superfluous re-renders on the Calculation Workspace when entering deep nested data table inputs.

## 10.8 User Acceptance Testing

User Acceptance Testing (UAT) involves stakeholders from the Costing Department evaluating the software against operational requirements. Based on UAT, key feedback was integrated:
- *Data Grid Usability*: Full arrow-key and `Tab` navigation was implemented inside the TanStack data table for the Grade Builder.
- *Calculation Debouncing*: A `500ms` debounce was introduced to the workspace state to resolve minor input lag during real-time updates.

## 10.9 Test Cases

The execution of Vitest and Playwright suites yields a deterministic test matrix that validates system stability prior to production releases.

| Test ID | Module | Scenario Description | Expected Outcome |
| --------- | -------- | ---------------------- | ------------------ |
| **TC-01** | Auth | Submit valid admin credentials | Redirect to `/dashboard` with valid HTTP-Only JWT |
| **TC-02** | Auth | Submit invalid credentials | Throw `401 Unauthorized` and show UI error |
| **TC-03** | RBAC | Non-admin accessing Settings | Throw `403 Forbidden` API exception |
| **TC-04** | Calc | Multi-material recipe computation | Total cost accurately calculates to 18-decimals |
| **TC-05** | Comp | Evaluate 3 grades simultaneously | Delta analytics chart renders 3 datasets |
| **TC-06** | Export | Trigger PDF Generation route | HTTP 200 with `application/pdf` blob |
| **TC-07** | CRUD | Create new Material definition | Table reflects immediate optimistic update |
| **TC-08** | Security | Submit CSV injection formula (`=cmd`) | Input sanitized via Regex / Zod validation |

## 10.10 Bug Fixes

    "Report Generation (MCMS)" : 10
```

<div align="center"><b>Figure 11.1</b>: Shift in Productivity Allocation (Engineers now focus on strategy rather than data aggregation)</div>

The User Experience (UX), heavily utilizing `@jsw-mcms/ui` standard components (Radix UI, Tailwind CSS), mimics established enterprise tools like SAP and PowerBI. The integration of optimistic UI updates, debounced inputs, and keyboard-navigable data tables resulted in a zero-learning-curve transition for existing staff.

## 11.6 Limitations

While the system fulfills current operational requirements, certain architectural limitations exist in the initial version:

1. **Cloud Infrastructure Constraints:** The reliance on specific cloud infrastructure for authentication and rapid backend deployment introduces mild vendor lock-in, requiring a migration strategy if JSW mandates a fully on-premise air-gapped infrastructure.
2. **Manual Rate Ingestion:** Spot rates for raw materials (Iron Ore, Coal) currently require manual data entry by the Costing Department, as integration with live commodity market APIs (e.g., Bloomberg Terminal) was out of scope.
3. **Stateless offline mode:** The application requires a persistent network connection. If intranet connectivity fails, the SPA cannot cache mutation requests for offline synchronization.

## 11.7 Future Enhancements

To further elevate the platform's capabilities, the following enhancements are recommended for future iterations:

1. **SAP ERP Bidirectional Sync:** Integrating MCMS directly with JSW's existing SAP infrastructure via SOAP/REST middleware to automatically pull live inventory rates and push finalized grade costs back to production planning.
2. **AI/ML Price Forecasting:** Utilizing historical rate data stored in PostgreSQL to train machine learning models (e.g., ARIMA or LSTMs) to predict raw material cost fluctuations and suggest optimal recipe adjustments.
3. **Live Commodity API Integration:** Automating the rate management module by subscribing to live commodity index APIs.
4. **Mobile-Responsive Adaptation:** While the current iteration is optimized for desktop (1080p minimum), adapting the dashboard and approval workflows for mobile form factors would aid executives in remote decision-making.

## 11.8 Chapter Summary

Chapter 11 detailed the highly successful outcomes of the MCMS project. By replacing fragmented, manual legacy workflows with a unified, cloud-native architecture, the platform achieved massive improvements in calculation velocity, data integrity, and operational security. While minor limitations regarding manual data ingestion and vendor reliance exist, the platform establishes a robust, highly extensible foundation. Future integrations with SAP and predictive AI forecasting position MCMS to become a critical asset in JSW Steel's strategic pricing operations.

## Appendix I — Flowcharts

This appendix consolidates the core systemic flowcharts and data flow paths that govern the JSW MCMS platform.

### 1. System Context Diagram
The Context Diagram illustrates the system boundaries, showing external actors and the inputs and outputs of the MCMS platform:

```mermaid
graph TD
    Costing[Costing Department Analyst] -->|Material Rates, Cost Sheets Inputs| MCMS(((MCMS Application Platform)))
    PDQC[PDQC Metallurgical Engineer] -->|Steel Grade Spec & tolerances| MCMS
    Admin[System Administrator] -->|User Configurations & Access Rights| MCMS
    
    MCMS -->|Cost Sheets, PDF & Excel Exports, Comparison Matrices| Costing
    MCMS -->|Grade Limits, Workspace Calculations| PDQC
    MCMS -->|System Auditing Logs & Active Accounts List| Admin
```

### 2. Data Flow Diagram (DFD) Level 0
The DFD Level 0 maps out the internal processes, data stores, and data movements:

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph Actors [Actors]
        Costing[Costing Analyst]
        PDQC[PDQC Engineer]
        Admin[System Admin]
    end
    subgraph Processes [Processes]
        P1[1.0 Manage Material Rates]
        P2[2.0 Build Grade Recipes]
        P3[3.0 Execute Calculations]
        P4[4.0 Audit & Manage Users]
    end
    subgraph Stores [Data Stores]
        D1[(D1: Materials & Price History)]
        D2[(D2: Grade Specs)]
        D3[(D3: Calculations & Snapshots)]
        D4[(D4: User Accounts & Roles)]
        D5[(D5: System Audit Logs)]
    end

    Costing -->|Input New Prices| P1
    P1 -->|Store Rate History| D1
    
    PDQC -->|Define Element Limits| P2
    P2 -->|Store Grade Specs| D2
    
    Costing -->|Select Grade & Mix Weights| P3
    P3 -->|Query Active Rates| D1
    P3 -->|Query Element Specs| D2
    P3 -->|Write Calculation Snapshot| D3
    P3 -->|Log Activity| P4
    
    Admin -->|Modify Profiles| P4
    P4 -->|Store User Info| D4
    P4 -->|Write Audit Log| D5
```

### 3. State Machine Diagram (Defect QA Lifecycle)
The QA workflow tracking state mutations during UAT validation:

```mermaid

    direction LR
    [*] --> Discovered: Bug Identified
    Discovered --> Triaged: QA Assessment
    Triaged --> InProgress: Assigned to Engineer
    
    InProgress --> CodeReview: Fix Implemented
    CodeReview --> IntegrationTesting: PR Approved
    
    IntegrationTesting --> InProgress: Regression Failed
    IntegrationTesting --> Resolved: Tests Pass
    
    Resolved --> UAT: Deployed to Staging
    UAT --> InProgress: Feedback / Re-opened
    UAT --> Closed: Accepted by Stakeholder
    Closed --> [*]
```

## Appendix J — Source Code Structure

The project utilizes a TurboRepo monorepo to share configurations, types, utilities, and components between the React frontend client and the Express backend API:

| **Environment Variables** | Formatted in `.env` matching `.env.example` |

### Local Development Setup

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url> jsw-mcms && cd jsw-mcms

# 2. Install all monorepo workspace dependencies
npm install

# 3. Configure environment files
cp .env.example .env
cp apps/backend/.env.example apps/backend/.env
cp apps/frontend/.env.example apps/frontend/.env

# 4. Perform Prisma Client generation and push schema migrations
npm run prisma:generate
npm run prisma:migrate
npm run seed

# 5. Launch the frontend and backend development servers
npm run dev
```

Verify local setup by checking the health endpoint: `GET http://localhost:4000/api/health` (should return `{"status":"ok","service":"mcms-api"}`).

### Docker Containerized Setup

For running the entire stack via Docker containers:

```bash
# 1. Build the monorepo services
docker compose build

# 2. Spin up backend, frontend, and PostgreSQL containers in detached mode
docker compose up -d

# 3. Run database migrations inside the active API container
docker compose exec api npx prisma migrate dev

# 4. Seed the PostgreSQL instance with master costing data
docker compose exec api npx prisma db seed
```

Access the application at `http://localhost:5173` (Frontend) and `http://localhost:4000` (Backend).
